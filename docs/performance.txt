# Performance Comparison – Trimming vs Full Prime List

Measured using 10 consecutive file generations in batches of 20 files each (`start_file = x * 500 + 2`).

| File Range      | Time (Full Primes) | Time (Trimmed Primes) | Improvement (%) |
|-----------------|--------------------|------------------------|------------------|
| 2–21            | 14.40 s            | 14.38 s                | 0.14%            |
| 502–521         | 18.56 s            | 17.77 s                | 4.26%            |
| 1002–1021       | 18.94 s            | 18.38 s                | 2.96%            |
| 1502–1521       | 18.98 s            | 18.76 s                | 1.16%            |
| 2002–2021       | 19.22 s            | 19.13 s                | 0.47%            |
| 2502–2521       | 19.44 s            | 19.21 s                | 1.18%            |
| 3002–3021       | 19.83 s            | 19.73 s                | 0.50%            |
| 3502–3521       | 20.73 s            | 19.65 s                | 5.21%            |
| 4002–4021       | 19.94 s            | 19.76 s                | 0.90%            |
| 4502–4521       | 20.49 s            | 19.79 s                | 3.42%            |

### Average Times

- **Full prime list:** 19.05 s
- **Trimmed primes:** 18.51 s
- **Average improvement:** **2.83%**

---

## Summary

- Trimming the `primes` array before file generation gives an **average speedup of ~2.8%** across large batches.
- In some cases (e.g. 3502–3521), the gain reaches over **5%**, suggesting that the benefit increases with file number and prime list size.
- While modest per run, this optimization saves **significant time in long-running or multi-process scenarios**.





## ⏱️ Performance Comparison: Slicing Every 500 vs Once

| Method                      | Primes Cut To | File Range       | Time (s)     |
|----------------------------|---------------|------------------|--------------|
| 🔁 Slicing Every 500       | 4,813         | 1–20             | 2.505483     |
| 🔁 Slicing Every 500       | 26,169        | 501–520          | 6.184003     |
| **Subtotal**               | —             | —                | **8.689486** |

| 🔁 Single Slice            | 27,832        | 1–20             | 2.490338     |
| 🔁 Single Slice            | 27,832        | 501–520          | 6.188749     |
| **Subtotal**               | —             | —                | **8.679087** |

### 📊 Result:
- **Difference**: `8.689486 - 8.679087 = 0.010399 s`
- **Improvement**: ~**0.12% faster** with single slicing

### ✅ Conclusion:
Slicing once instead of every 500 files gives nearly identical performance in this case, with less complexity.
